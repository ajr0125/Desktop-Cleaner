# Desktop-Cleaner

Overview

The Desktop Cleaner is a project designed to help users organize files on their desktop efficiently. The project includes two versions of the desktop cleaner:

Basic File Type Sorter: A simple script that categorizes files on the desktop into predefined folders based on their file types (e.g., Images, Documents, Audio, Videos, etc.).

Advanced GUI Version: A more user-friendly version with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. This version allows users to choose how they want to organize their files: by file type, size, or date.
